# Scripter

A Dalamud plugin to inspect the game's [Lua](https://lua.org) state and run custom Lua code.

## Features

* Inspect globals and explore the various table structures of the game's internal Lua state.
* Run arbitrary Lua scripts.
* Redirect the normally hidden Lua `print` output to the Dalamud log window.
